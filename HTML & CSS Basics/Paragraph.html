            The Importance of Time Management
        </h1>
        <p>Time management is the ability to plan and control how you spend your time so you can work efficiently and still have a life outside deadlines and panic. When used properly, it helps reduce stress, improves productivity, and allows you to focus on what actually matters instead of reacting to everything at the last minute. Good time management is not about doing more work nonstop; it is about doing the right work at the right time. People who manage time well make realistic schedules, set priorities, avoid unnecessary distractions, and finish tasks with better quality and less mental chaos. In short, time management separates people who stay in control from those who are always “busy” but never effective.</p>
